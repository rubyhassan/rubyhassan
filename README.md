# hi! i'm ruby. 


## i just moved to $${\color{#FFC627} gilbert}$$, $${\color{#FFC627} az}$$ 🏜️ <br> for my $${\color{orange} ms}$$ in $${\color{orange} user \\ experience}$$ <br> from $${\color{#A8324F} arizona \\ state \\ university}$$ 🎓


having always lived in tropical/humid settings, <br> i really should have paid closer attention when <br> *everyone* tried to warn me about the weather.. <br> <br>
