🎨 I’m a student in the **MS in UX program** at *Arizona State University* exploring the intersections of **design, tech, and human systems**.  
💡 Passionate about **user experience, accessibility, and educational technology**.  
✨ Outside of class, I love experimenting with **design projects, coding, and creative side quests**.  

🌱 Currently learning: GitHub workflows, UI prototyping, and all things UX research.  
📌 Goal: Build meaningful, human-centered tools that make tech more intuitive and accessible.
